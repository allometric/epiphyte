# epiphyte
A meta package for administering allometric.

Ideas:

Some tasks of allometric can take up a lot of nonsense time. `epiphyte` will help by automating or semi-automating some of these tasks. Here are some ideas for what we can speed up

1. Extracting citations from a paper and making GitHub issues for them.

There are a lot of omnibus publications, which are valuable resources containing references to primary sources of models. In some cases, these omnibus publications provide curated
lists of references, and in some exceptional cases we also get .bib files. It would be nice to auto-ingest these into GitHub issues, while also scanning for existing publications
in `models.RDS`.
